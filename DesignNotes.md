<h1>Design Notes</h1>
<h2>Search bar:</h2>
<ul>By default, a single line at top of search results containing:
  <li>a keyword search bar</li>
  <li>a department selector (from dropdown list)</li>
  <li>a "search" button</li>
  <li>an "expand" button</li>
</ul>
<ul>When expanded, further options appear:
  <li>Show closed courses (check box)</li>
  <li>Show courses which conflict (check box - default on)</li>
  <li>Show courses with unmet requirements (check box - default on)</li>
  <li>Show only honors courses (check box) (should this be its own button? or maybe just a keyword in search)</li>
  <li>Days of the week (check boxes, all checked by default)</li>
  <li>Course levels (check boxes, all checked by default)</li>
  <li># credits (check boxes, all checked by default)</li>
</ul>
<p>The following are options that should be included, but probably won't be used as frequently. 
Maybe they should be added as "advanced settings", and be hidden by default?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Session - University, CPE, etc</li>
  <li>Career - undergrad, etc</li>
  <li>Meeting time (start + end time)</li>
  <li>Academic term</li>
</ul>

<h2>Search Results:</h2>
<p>I propose two lines per result, with subtle highlighting for every other result to distinguish them.</p>
<ul>Line one:
  <li>Course #</li>
  <li>Course title</li>
  <li>expand button (maybe in second line)</li>
</ul>
<ul>Line two:
  <li>Days of the week</li>
  <li>Meeting time</li>
  <li>"Add course" button; also indicates whether there is a conflict, and with what</li>
  <li>Bookmark button</li>
</ul>
<ul>Expanded view:
  <li>Has lab/discussion</li>
  <li>Course description</li>
  <li>Instructor</li>
  <li>Prerequisites (and whether they are met)</li>
  <li>enrolled students, cap students</li>
  <li>waitlist enrolled/cap</li>
  <li>gened categories (AT/U etc)</li>
  <li># credits</li>
</ul>
